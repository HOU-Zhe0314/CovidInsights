# Data transformation
We first got the data by using the COVIDcast Epidata API. This data is the estimated percentage of COVID-related doctor's vistis, based on the outpatient visits.
The estimation works as follows:
For a fixed time t and location i, there are counts of Covid-like symptoms, Flu-like symptoms, Mixed symptoms, Clealy-Flu symptoms, and total counts of visits. Then estimate the percentage of COVID-like symptoms as:
100 * (CovidLike + FluLike + Mixed - ClearlyFlu) / total

To enhance variablility, a local linear regression filter with a Gaussian kernel is applied, the bandwidth is set to 7 to cover a rolling 7-day window.
