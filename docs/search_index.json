As up to 2021/12/11, COVID-19 has caused around 5.3 million deaths worldwide. Because of COVID-19, people are wearing masks all the time, many businesses went bankrupt, and transportation (especially between countries) has been heavily reduced. There are more changes COVID-19 has brought into our life, and we are dedicated to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on human life and economy in the U.S. which is among the most impacted countries. Specifically, we use the data aggregated by Carnegie Mellon University, and it contain various kinds of data, such as doctor visits and hospital related data, bar and restaurant visits data, Google search data. Through analyzing these data, we not only gained some insights of covid-19 pandemic and its influence on people and economy, but also found some interesting patterns of people’s behaviors during pandemic. So let’s start now! "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Description of Data 2.2 Basic information of Data", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Description of Data Our datasets all come from Delphi’s COVIDcast Epidata API. This API was developed by CMU Delphi Research Group, and we can easily fetch data in R studio using this API. Delphi’s COVIDcast Epidata API provides data of covid-19 pandemic across the United States. The data has a variety sources, for example, fb-survey, google search, Safegraph, CMU’s health system partners, and so on. In this book, we will use the data of Hospital Visits, Hospital Admissions, Bar Visits, Restaurant Visits, Google Search Volume, Survey about Depression, Survey about Isolation, and Survey about Financial Difficulty. 2.2 Basic information of Data With the help of the API, we retrieved 8 datasets. 2.2.1 Hospital Visits Data This dataset is about the estimated percentage of COVID-related doctor’s vistis, based on the outpatient visits. The outpatient visits data comes from Carnegie Mellon University’s health system partners. There 12 variables for this dataset, but according to the description of the API, only 3 variables matter: ‘location’, ‘time’, ‘smoothed estimated percentage of COVID-related doctor’s vistis’. For ‘location’, we only picked 9 states for analysis: 2 from west coast (CA, WA), 2 from east coast (NY, VA), 2 from middle (CO, KS, MO), 1 from south (TX), and 1 relatively remote states (HI). For ‘time’, we analyzed data of one year, from 2020-02-01 to 2021-02-01. We picked 2020-02-01 as the start date, because that is roughly when COVID-19 started wide-spreading in the U.S. There are 3303 samples in total, corresponding to different time and locations. 2.2.2 Hospital Admissions Data It is the dataset of the estimated percentage of new hospital admissions with COVID-related symptoms. The data also comes from Carnegie Mellon University’s health system partners. The meaningful variables are: ‘location’, ‘time’, ‘smoothed estimated percentage of new hospital admissions related to COVID’. For consistency, we also picked the same 9 states and the same time interval. There are 3303 samples in total, corresponding to different time and locations. 2.2.3 Restaurant Visit Data &amp; Bar Visit Data We have two datasets here, one is about restaurant visit and the other is about bar vist. Specifically, the data is the number of daily visits to restaurants (or bars) by users of the ‘SafeGraph’ app, per 100000 population in different states. The data is provided by the ‘SafeGraph’ app. Still three meaningful variables here: ‘location’, ‘time’, ‘visits to restaurants (or bars) by users of the ’SafeGraph’ app, per 100000 population’. For consistency, we picked the same nine states and the same time interval as above. There are 3240 samples in total, corresponding to different time and locations. 2.2.4 Google Search Trends symptems data This data is the total number of Google search volume for anosmia (loss of smell abilities) and ageusia (loss of taste abilities) related searches. The data originally comes from Google. The meaningful variables are: ‘location’, ‘time’, ‘sum of Google search volume for anosmia and ageusia related searches’. For consistency, we also picked the same 9 states and the same time interval. There are 2837 samples in total, corresponding to different time and locations. 2.2.5 Survey about Depression, Isolation, and Financial Difficulty The three datasets are about the percentage of people who expressed depression, isolation, and financial difficulty, respectively, in a survey by Facebook. Three meaningful variables here: ‘location’, ‘time’, ‘percentage of people who expressed depression (or isolation, or financial difficulty)’. The available date for the datasets starts from 2020-09-08, so we picked the data from 2020-09-08 to 2021-02-01. The locations remain the same as above. More details about the whole data set please refer to: https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_licensing.html "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Hospital Visits Data 3.2 Hospital Admissions Data 3.3 Restaurant Visit Data &amp; Bar Visit Data 3.4 Survey about Depression, Isolation, and Financial Difficulty 3.5 Google Search Trends symptems data", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Hospital Visits Data The estimation of “the percentage of COVID-related doctor’s vistis” works as follows: For a fixed time t and location i, there are counts of Covid-like symptoms, Flu-like symptoms, Mixed symptoms, Clealy-Flu symptoms, and total counts of visits. Then estimate the percentage of COVID-like symptoms as: 100 * (CovidLike + FluLike + Mixed - ClearlyFlu) / total To enhance variablility, a local linear regression filter with a Gaussian kernel is applied, the bandwidth is set to 7 to cover a rolling 7-day window. However, after smoothing the data, the standard error estimate is claimed to be inaccurate any more, so we just removed the column of standard errors. According to the API, only three columns are meaningful for analysis, and all the other columns consist of the same value all the way through, so we just removed them. Hence, the resulting variables in the dataset are: ‘location’, ‘time’, ‘smoothed estimated percentage of COVID-related doctor’s vistis’. 3.2 Hospital Admissions Data This data went through the same smoothing adjustment as above. So for the same reason, we removed the columns associated with standard error and all other columns that consist of the same value all the way through. The resulting variables are: ‘location’, ‘time’, ‘smoothed estimated percentage of new hospital admissions related to COVID’. 3.3 Restaurant Visit Data &amp; Bar Visit Data Same reason as above. The resulting variables are: ‘location’, ‘time’, ‘visits to restaurants (or bars) by users of the ’SafeGraph’ app, per 100000 population’. 3.4 Survey about Depression, Isolation, and Financial Difficulty Same reason as above. The resulting variables are: ‘location’, ‘time’, ‘percentage of people who expressed depression (or isolation, or financial difficulty)’ 3.5 Google Search Trends symptems data This data measured in arbitrary units that are normalized for overall search users in the region and then scaled by the maximum value of the normalized popularity in a specific region and a specific time range. In this data, large numebrs stand for increased releative popularity of symptom-related searches. The resulting variables are: ‘location’, ‘time’, ‘sum of Google search volume for anosmia and ageusia related searches’.

Therefore, we made an interactive plot to visualize the average percentage of COVID-related doctor visits in different states. We can see that New York (NY) and Minnesota (MN) suffered most from COVID-related doctor visits, and Montana (MT) did not have many COVID-related doctor visits during that one year. However, we can not see a clear geographical pattern from the plot. Thus, we picked we picked nine states all over the continent of the U.S. for analysis. 5.2 Impact of COVID-19 on Bars and Restaurants This is a visualization of Google search volume for anosmia and ageusia related searches. We can see that search volume exploded in March, obviously this is because the first break of covid-19, and the virus caught people’s attention for the first time. After that, anosmia and ageusia related searches became stabilized, however, it showed a increasing trend in December, we speculated that it’s because there was a small outbreak of covid at that time. To find out how pandemic influences people and economy, we then explored data of bar visits and restaurant visits. As we all know, covid started to outbreak in February 2020. From the graph we can also see that after the outbreak of virus, bar visits and restaurant visits dropped sharply, and because the pandemic continued, these numbers stayed low. Correspondingly, we can see that bar visits and restaurant visits are a little bit low in December, which is consistent with what we found before, and this also indicates that people had some attention on the pandemic, and some people indeed reduced the number of visits to the bar. Here for restaurants we see a remarkably different pattern. We can see that after the first outbreak of the pandemic, people eating outside deceased sharply, however, after April, this number increased, which means that many people started to eat outside again. Maybe it’s because eating outside for many people is necessary due to the lack of cooking skills or it’s important way for them to have fun with friends. To find out the influence of pandemic on bar visits, here we combine the data of covid related hospital visits, which indicate the seriousness of pandemic, and bar visits. Form the graph we can see that whexn covid related hospital visits was close to 0, many people liked going to bar for fun, but after the covid pandemic became serious, especially when there were more and more covid cases and covid related hospital visits increased, number of people going to bar decreased. For example, Hiwaii, there were more than 600 people per 100,000 people going to bar in some no covid day, but after the increase of covid related visits, which indicates severer of pandemic, it never happened again that there were so many people going to bar. However, in the graph of covid related hospital visits VS resturant visits (per 100,000 population), we find that after pandemic, even if people eating outside have some decreasing, but many people still choosed eat outside, especially for Missouri and Kansas, which is consistent with our findings before. When put data of bar visits and resturant visits into on graph, we can see that people eating outside significantly higher than people visiting the bar. Especially in Hiwaii, when the pandemic was not so serious, people going to bar was more than people eating outside, but during the serious pandemic, there were more people eating outside than people going to bar surprisingly, so we think that influence of pandemic on bars may be bigger than on resturants. To observe the influence of covid-19 on resturants and bars more clearly, we draw a slope graph to compare bar and resturant visits when pandemic was serious to when there pandemic was not serious. Here we define that when percentage of outpatient doctor visits primarily about COVID-related symptoms is less than or equal to 1, we take it as pandemic is not serious, when percentage of outpatient doctor visits primarily about COVID-related symptoms is greater than 1, we take it as pandemic is serious. We can clearly find that even during time when covid-19 became more serious, people eating outside didn’t decrease much. When considering proportion, we can see that proportion of deacreasing number of bar visits is higher than that of resturant visits, so we can say that influence of covid-19 on bars is higher than resturants. There are many reasons can lead to this situation, we speculate that maybe it’s because bar isn’t necessary for many people’s life, but restaurants are. In addtion, bars are more crowded, which makes it more dangerous during pandemic. 5.3 Stressed Exerted on Hospitals by COVID-19 The line plos are comparing the COVID-related hospital admissions and COVID-related doctor visits in different states. The y-axis is the percentage of the two, and the x-axis is the time (in terms of day). This is like the sanity check of the two datasets. We can see that the patterns of two lines are similar in all 9 states, and intuitively the percentages of doctor visits and hospital admissions should follow a similar pattern. Therefore, the sanity check passes. Next, we wanted to explore how much stress COVID-19 exerted on hospitals in the nine states. In order to achieve this, we took the ratio of COVID-related doctor_visits to COVID-repated hospital_admissions as the KPI. If the ratio is large, it means that the needs for hospital admissions are well-satisfied, and thus no great stress on the hospitals. Vice versa. From this plot, we can see that New York (black), Hawaii (blue), and Colorado (yellow), could satisfy the hospital needs relatively well among the nine states, as their respective lines are well-above the other lines. Therefore, New York and Hawaii were least stressed by COVID in terms of hospital admissions among the nine states from 2020-02-01 to 2021-02-01. It’s worth noticing that although New York was among the states with highest percentages of COVID-related doctor visits, it was among the states that were least stressed by COVID in terms of hospital admissions. However, the lines on the bottom are intertwined together, so it’s hard to see the pattern. Therefore, we made a barplot to visualize the mean acceptance_ratio in the one year. We can see that the mean for New York, Colorado, and Hawaii, are well-above the others, and Washington seems to have a relatively small mean, which means Washington suffered great stress to satisfy the need for hospital admissions. This conclusion is consistent with what we see from the last plot in which Washington (brown) had been well-below the others throughout the year. 5.4 Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health and Financial Situation Now we want to investigate how COVID-19 influenced people’s mental health and financial situation. Specifically, we will use data from Facebook surveys about people’s feeling of depression, isolation, and financial difficulty. Note that the date is from 2020-09-08 to 2021-02-01. We extrapolated that restaurant visits or bar visits may help with negative emotions, and negative emotions may affect each other (e.g. financial difficulty may result in more depression) Therefore, we put together the following data: percentage of people who feel depressed, percentage of people who feel isolation, percentage of people who feel financial difficulty, number of bar visits per 100000 people, number of restaurant visits per 100000 people; and made a biplot to investigate if there’s any relationship between them. ## Importance of components: ## PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 ## Standard deviation 1.5682 1.1931 0.8210 0.66586 8.15e-16 ## Proportion of Variance 0.4918 0.2847 0.1348 0.08868 0.00e+00 ## Cumulative Proportion 0.4918 0.7765 0.9113 1.00000 1.00e+00 As indicated above, 77.65 percent of the variances can be explained by the first two PCs. From the biplot, we can see that the percentage of isolation and the percentage of depression are highly correlated, as the two arrows are even superposed on each other in the plot. This is intuitive because depression and feeling of isolation always come together. What’s more, the percentage of feeling financial difficulty was negatively correlated with both of them. It means that people with less financial difficulty feel more depression (or isolation) during COVID situation. This is not an intuitive observation, but a far-fetched explanation could be that wealthier people would have more means to learn about the COVID situation and thus get more depressed. From the biplot, we can also see that the number of bar visits and the number of restaurant visits are positively correlated, and they don’t seem to be correlated with either financial difficulty, depression or isolation. Therefore, we drew scatterplots of Restaurant Visit vs. Bar Visit, faceted by states, to explore the relationship between the two variables. Each point represents the data of a certain day. We can see that people in Washington didn’t go to restaurants very often, and as discussed above, Washington could not satisfy the needs for hospital admissions very well. Therefore, it seems that the COVID situation was the most severe in Washington among the 9 states during that one-year period. In the other 8 states, the number of bar visits and the number of restaurant visits have high correlation, as suggested by the plots. This is reasonable, because COVID situation would affect bar visits and restaurant visits simultaneously. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 COVID-related Doctor Visits", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 COVID-related Doctor Visits This is a dynamic visualization of change in the average percentage of COVID-related doctor visits by month, from Feb 2020 to Jan 2021.

The time interval was set to be from 2020-02-01 to 2021-02-01. First, we examined how COVID-19 impacted bars and restaurants. We discovered that bars and Restaurants are affected by the pandemic in different level. Unfortunately, bars are affected more, we speculate that it’s because going to bars are not necessary for many people, it’s more like a way for fun and can be easily replaced by other means, and what’s more, bars are usually full of people, and people are more likely to be infected. But as for restaurants, eating outside is necessary for many people, because their work is too busy so that they have no time to cook for themselves or their lack of cooking skills, so after a short decrease at the beginning of outbreak of pandemic, people eating outside became a lot again. After that, we analyzed the stress exerted on hospitals by COVID-19. We took the ratio of COVID-related doctor_visits to COVID-repated hospital_admissions as the KPI, and found out that New York, Hawaii and Colorado suffered less stress from satisfying hospital needs among the 9 states we analyzed, and Washington suffered the most. At last, we investigated how COVID-19 influenced people’s mental health and financial situation by using the data from Facebook surveys. It turned out that the feeling of depression and isolation always came together. There was another not very intuitive conclusion that less financial difficulty tended to come with more depression. We also got an unexpected discovery that the number of bar visits were correlated with the number of restaurant visits, and that people in Washington (using the Safegraph APP) had a very low frequency of going to restaurants. 7.2 Limitation Due to the privacy problem, the Google search data is processed by Google, to be more specific, they adds artificial noise to the raw data to avoid any individual persons is identified and some data are incomplete, and this may affect analysis potentially. If it’s possible, analyze on the original data is better in the future. We only picked 9 states, and that may not be general enough. One improvement would be picking more states to see if the patterns we found still apply. 7.3 Lesson Learned Dive into data. We may think data pattern is obvious or the data is easy so that we have so little to analyze, but if you observe the data carefully, perform various transformations on the data, you may then find some interesting results that you haven’t expect before.
