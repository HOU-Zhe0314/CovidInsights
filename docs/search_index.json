As up to 2021/12/11, COVID-19 has caused around 5.3 million deaths worldwide. Because of COVID-19, people are wearing masks all the time, many businesses went bankrupt, and transportation (especially between countries) has been heavily reduced. There are more changes COVID-19 has brought into our life, and we are dedicated to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on human life and economy in the U.S., which is among the most impacted countries. We will explore the impact of COVID-19 in some detailed aspects (e.g. restaurants, hospitals) and in a large scale (e.g. across the country). "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Our data comes from Delphi’s COVIDcast Epidata API. This is the documentation for accessing Delphi’s COVID-19 indicators via the covidcast endpoint of Delphi’s epidemiological data API. This API provides data on the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across the United States, most of which is available at the county level and updated daily. This data powers our public COVIDcast map which includes testing, cases, and death data, as well as unique healthcare and survey data Delphi acquires through its partners. The API allows users to select specific signals and download data for selected geographical areas—counties, states, metropolitan statistical areas, and other divisions. Delphi’s COVIDcast Epidata API provides data of covid-19 pandemic across the United States and it’s updated daily. The data has a variety sources, for example, fb-survey, google search, jhu and so on, which allows us not only gain insights of covid-19 pandemic from the basic statistcs like case data and death data, but also find some interesting facts from the people’s google search behaviors. More details about the data please refer to: https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_licensing.html "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Hospital Visits Data 3.2 Hospital Admissions Data", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Hospital Visits Data We first got the data by using the COVIDcast Epidata API. This data is the estimated percentage of COVID-related doctor’s vistis, based on the outpatient visits. The outpatient visits data comes from Carnegie Mellon University’s health system partners. The estimation works as follows: For a fixed time t and location i, there are counts of Covid-like symptoms, Flu-like symptoms, Mixed symptoms, Clealy-Flu symptoms, and total counts of visits. Then estimate the percentage of COVID-like symptoms as: 100 * (CovidLike + FluLike + Mixed - ClearlyFlu) / total To enhance variablility, a local linear regression filter with a Gaussian kernel is applied, the bandwidth is set to 7 to cover a rolling 7-day window. Note that we only picked nine states for analysis: 2 from west coast (CA, WA), 2 from east coast (NY, VA), 2 from middle (CO, KS, MO), and two relatively remote states (HI, AK). And we analyzed data from 2020-02-01 to 2021-02-01. However, after smoothing the data, the standard error estimate is claimed to be inaccurate any more, so the standard error appears to be missing the dataset and we just removed the column. Hence, the resulting variables in the dataset are: ‘location’, ‘time’, ‘smoothed estimated percentage of COVID-related doctor’s vistis’. 3.2 Hospital Admissions Data This data is also retrieved using COVIDcast Epidata API. It is the data of the estimated percentage of new hospital admissions with COVID-related symptoms. The data also comes from Carnegie Mellon University’s health system partners. For consistency, we also picked the nine states and the same time interval. This data went through the same smoothing adjustment as above. So for the same reason, we removed the columns associated with standard error. The resulting variables are: ‘location’, ‘time’, ‘smoothed estimated percentage of new hospital admissions related to COVID’. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values The following is the number of missing values in each column: ## stderr sample_size data_source signal ## 85828 85828 0 0 ## geo_value time_value issue lag ## 0 0 0 0 ## missing_value missing_stderr missing_sample_size value ## 0 0 0 0 We found that there are two columns that consist of only missing values, and the other columns don’t have missing values. So there is only one pattern of missing values, as suggested by the plot. Since the two whole columns are missing values, we could just discard these two columns when analyzing.
