As up to 2021/12/11, COVID-19 has caused around 5.3 million deaths worldwide. Because of COVID-19, people are wearing masks all the time, many businesses went bankrupt, and transportation (especially between countries) has been heavily reduced. There are more changes COVID-19 has brought into our life, and we are dedicated to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on human life and economy in the U.S., which is among the most impacted countries. We will explore the impact of COVID-19 in some detailed aspects (e.g. restaurants, hospitals) and in a large scale (e.g. across the country). "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Our data comes from Delphi’s COVIDcast Epidata API. This is the documentation for accessing Delphi’s COVID-19 indicators via the covidcast endpoint of Delphi’s epidemiological data API. This API provides data on the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across the United States, most of which is available at the county level and updated daily. This data powers our public COVIDcast map which includes testing, cases, and death data, as well as unique healthcare and survey data Delphi acquires through its partners. The API allows users to select specific signals and download data for selected geographical areas—counties, states, metropolitan statistical areas, and other divisions. Delphi’s COVIDcast Epidata API provides data of covid-19 pandemic across the United States and it’s updated daily. The data has a variety sources, for example, fb-survey, google search, jhu and so on, which allows us not only gain insights of covid-19 pandemic from the basic statistcs like case data and death data, but also find some interesting facts from the people’s google search behaviors.

This data is the estimated percentage of COVID-related doctor’s vistis, based on the outpatient visits. The outpatient visits data comes from Carnegie Mellon University’s health system partners. The estimation works as follows: For a fixed time t and location i, there are counts of Covid-like symptoms, Flu-like symptoms, Mixed symptoms, Clealy-Flu symptoms, and total counts of visits. Then estimate the percentage of COVID-like symptoms as: 100 * (CovidLike + FluLike + Mixed - ClearlyFlu) / total To enhance variablility, a local linear regression filter with a Gaussian kernel is applied, the bandwidth is set to 7 to cover a rolling 7-day window. Note that we only picked nine states for analysis: 2 from west coast (CA, WA), 2 from east coast (NY, VA), 2 from middle (CO, KS, MO), and two relatively remote states (HI, AK). And we analyzed data from 2020-02-01 to 2021-02-01. However, after smoothing the data, the standard error estimate is claimed to be inaccurate any more, so the standard error appears to be missing the dataset and we just removed the column. Hence, the resulting variables in the dataset are: ‘location’, ‘time’, ‘smoothed estimated percentage of COVID-related doctor’s vistis’. There are 3303 samples in total, corresponding to different time and locations. 3.2 Hospital Admissions Data This data is also retrieved using COVIDcast Epidata API. It is the data of the estimated percentage of new hospital admissions with COVID-related symptoms. The data also comes from Carnegie Mellon University’s health system partners. For consistency, we also picked the nine states and the same time interval. This data went through the same smoothing adjustment as above. So for the same reason, we removed the columns associated with standard error. The resulting variables are: ‘location’, ‘time’, ‘smoothed estimated percentage of new hospital admissions related to COVID’. There are 2952 sample in total, corresponding to different time and locations. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values The following is the number of missing values in each column: We found that there are two columns that consist of only missing values, and the other columns don’t have missing values. So there is only one pattern of missing values, as suggested by the plot. Since the two whole columns are missing values, we could just discard these two columns when analyzing. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Doctor Visits vs. Hospital Admissions", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Doctor Visits vs. Hospital Admissions The line plot is comparing the hospital admissions and doctor visits in different states. The y-axis is the percentage of the two, and the x-axis is the time (in terms of day). This is like the sanity check of the two datasets. We can see that the patterns of two lines are similar in all 9 states, and intuitively the percentages of doctor visits and hospital admissions should follow a similar pattern. Therefore, the sanity check passes. It’s worth noticing that Alaska only has data for a few days, but the percentages still look similar. Next, we wanted to explore how much stress COVID-19 exerted on hospitals in the nine states. In order to achieve this, we took the ratio of hospital_admissions to doctor_visits as the KPI. If the ratio is large, it means that the needs for hospital admissions are well-satisfied, and thus no great stress on the hospitals. Vice versa. From this plot, we can see that New York (dark), Hawaii (green), and Colorado (blue), can satisfy the hospital admissions relatively well among the nine states, as their respective lines are well-above the other lines. Therefore, New York and Hawaii were least stressed by COVID in terms of hospital admissions among the nine states from 2020-02-01 to 2021-02-01. However, the lines on the bottom are intertwined together, so it’s hard to see the pattern. Therefore, we made a barplot to visualize the mean acceptance_ratio in the one year. We can see that the mean for New York, Colorado, and Hawaii, are well-above the others, and Washington seems to have a relatively small mean, which means Washington suffered great stress to satisfy the need for hospital admissions. This conclusion is consistent with what we see from the last plot in which Washington (brown) had been well-below the others throughout the year. We removed ‘VI’ - Virgin Islands, because it is not an official state of the U.S. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
