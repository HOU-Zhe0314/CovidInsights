This is the documentation for accessing Delphi’s COVID-19 indicators via the covidcast endpoint of Delphi’s epidemiological data API. This API provides data on the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across the United States, most of which is available at the county level and updated daily. This data powers our public COVIDcast map which includes testing, cases, and death data, as well as unique healthcare and survey data Delphi acquires through its partners. The API allows users to select specific signals and download data for selected geographical areas—counties, states, metropolitan statistical areas, and other divisions. Delphi’s COVIDcast Epidata API provides data of covid-19 pandemic across the United States and it’s updated daily. The data has a variety sources, for example, fb-survey, google search, jhu and so on, which allows us not only gain insights of covid-19 pandemic from the basic statistcs like case data and death data, but also find some interesting facts from the people’s google search behaviors. More details about the data please refer to: https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_licensing.html "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Our data need no transformation, because Delphi has written extensive software to obtain data from various sources, aggregate the data, calculate statistical estimates, and format the data to be shared through the COVIDcast API. We can use this API to fetch the data we want directly.

So there is only one pattern of missing values, as suggested by the plot. Since the two whole columns are missing values, we could just discard these two columns when analyzing.
