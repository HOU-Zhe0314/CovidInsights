# Introduction
COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has swept across the globe, causing countless deaths and enormous impact on people's life. As up to 2021/12/11, COVID-19 has caused around 5.3 million deaths worldwide. Because of COVID-19, people are wearing masks all the time, many businesses went bankrupt, and transportation (especially between countries) has been heavily reduced. There are more changes COVID-19 has brought into our life, and we are dedicated to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on human life and economy in the U.S., which is among the most impacted countries. 

We will explore the impact of COVID-19 in some detailed aspects (e.g. restaurants, hospitals) and in a large scale (e.g. across the country).
